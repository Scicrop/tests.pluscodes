# tests.pluscodes
Simple java offline implementation of pluscodes

## What does this code do
It converts a latitude and longitude into a PlusCode, in three formats: Full, Within and Shortened. The conversion is made offline, without any remote API call.

It does not shows a semantic form of address, with city name, country name, or other names, like streets, avenues, or even house numbers.

## Building

Before start, check the basic requirements: Java 8 or higher and Maven

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/google/open-location-code
$ cd cd open-location-code/java/
$ cd ../../
$ git clone https://github.com/Scicrop/tests.pluscodes
$ cd tests.pluscodes
$ mvn package
```
If you are using Eclipse IDE and have this problem: **Plugin execution not covered by lifecycle configuration: com.diffplug.spotless:spotless-maven-plugin:1.23.0:check (execution: spotless, phase: compile)** in the pom.xml from open-location-code package you can just comment the **\<execution>** block inside pom.xml.

```sh
$ java -jar target/tests.pluscodes-0.0.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar -23.982528 -46.916556
